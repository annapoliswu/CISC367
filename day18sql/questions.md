1. Display all the data from the houseware table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM houseware
```

2. Get just the name of every houseware.

```sql
SELECT name FROM houseware
```

3. Get just the name and price of every houseware.

```sql
SELECT name, buy_price FROM houseware
```

4. [DISTINCT] Get the name of every recipe material (no duplicates).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM houseware
```

5. [WHERE] What houseware items can be sold for at least 1000 bells? 

```sql
SELECT name FROM houseware WHERE buy_price >= 1000
```

6. [WHERE] I want to find any houseware that can fit in a 1x1 space (width x height) that costs less than 1000 bells.

```sql
SELECT name FROM houseware WHERE buy_price < 1000 and height * width <= 1
```

7. [WHERE, LIKE] I'm looking for stuff that involves the word office, but there's no office tag. Get me a list of all the names that involve the word 'office'.

```sql
SELECT name FROM houseware WHERE name LIKE '%office%'
```

8. [COUNT] How many houseware items are there?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(name) FROM houseware
```

9. [WHERE with COUNT] How many many items can be bought for less than 1000 bells?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(name) FROM houseware WHERE buy_price < 1000
```

10. [AGGREGATION] How much is the average buying price divided by selling price?

```sql
SELECT AVG(buy_price)/AVG(sell_price)FROM houseware
```

11. [AGGREGATION, TYPES] How much is the average selling price divided by buying price, rounded to two decimal places?

```sql
SELECT round(AVG(buy_price)/AVG(sell_price), 2) FROM houseware
```

12. [ORDER] Produce a list of all the names of the houseware items and their sell price, ordered by their sell price.

```sql
SELECT name, sell_price FROM houseware ORDER BY sell_price
```

13. [ORDER, LIMIT] Now produce the list of names+buy_price, ordered by buy_price descending, limited to the top 10.

```sql
SELECT name, buy_price FROM houseware ORDER BY buy_price DESC LIMIT 10
```

14. [ORDER, ALIAS] The hha_base is a number indicating how "nice" the item is. I want to find items that are have a higher hha_base per square unit of space. Produce a list of the names of items, sorted by their hha_base divided by the area they take up.

```sql
SELECT name FROM houseware ORDER BY (hha_base/(height*width))
```

15. [GROUP BY] How many houseware items are in each tag? Make sure you order them by frequency!

```sql
SELECT tag, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM houseware GROUP BY tag ORDER BY frequency
```

16. [GROUP BY, ALIAS] There's actually only a few different possible areas for the given objects. How many are there of each possible area?

```sql
SELECT (height * width) as area, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM houseware GROUP BY area ORDER BY area
```

17. [GROUP BY, AGGREGATION] How much would it cost to buy all the items, within each tag? For example, the Audio tag's items would cumulatively cost 103600

```sql
SELECT tag, SUM(buy_price) FROM houseware GROUP BY tag
```

18. [GROUP BY, WHERE, AGGREGATION] How much area would all the interactable houseware items take, within each tag?

```sql
SELECT tag, SUM(height * width) as total_area FROM houseware WHERE interact = 1 GROUP BY tag

```

19. [JOIN, GROUP BY] For each item, how many distinct materials does it require?

```sql
SELECT houseware.name, COUNT(recipe.amount)
FROM houseware, houseware_recipe, recipe
WHERE recipe.recipe_id = houseware_recipe.recipe_id AND houseware_recipe.houseware_id = houseware.id 
GROUP BY houseware.name

```

20 [GROUP BY, ORDER, LIMIT] What are the top 10 materials used in recipes (calculated by totaling the amounts per material).

```sql
SELECT material, SUM(amount) FROM recipe GROUP BY material ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC LIMIT 10

```

21. [JOIN, WHERE] List all the recipes that require at least 10 star fragments

```sql
SELECT houseware.name
FROM houseware, houseware_recipe, recipe
WHERE recipe.recipe_id = houseware_recipe.recipe_id 
AND houseware_recipe.houseware_id = houseware.id 
AND recipe.material = 'star fragment' 
AND recipe.amount >= 10
```

22. [JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER] What tag has the most recipes that require 'stone'?

```sql
SELECT houseware.tag, COUNT(recipe.recipe_id)
FROM houseware, houseware_recipe, recipe
WHERE recipe.recipe_id = houseware_recipe.recipe_id 
AND houseware_recipe.houseware_id = houseware.id 
AND recipe.material = 'stone'
GROUP BY houseware.tag 
ORDER BY COUNT(recipe.recipe_id) DESC
```

23. [JOIN, WHERE] Get the names and colors of all housewares.

```sql
SELECT houseware.name, variation_color.name
FROM houseware, variation, variation_color
WHERE houseware.id = variation.houseware_id 
AND variation.id = variation_color.variation_id
```
