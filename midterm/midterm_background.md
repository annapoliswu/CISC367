# Midterm Background

## Problem: 

Racial inequality and disparity in education. 

## Questions:

- What are the differences in student performance across different races in Delaware?
- Is there currently still a disparity in student performance between white studente and students of color in Delaware? 
- If there is a disparity, how might it have changed over time?

## Justification:

In the United States, there has long been a history of educational disparities between African American and White students. There've been records of significant differences in average standardized testing scores between the two groups [1], as well as biases in teacher expectation, which may contribute to performance differences in students [1,2]. These differences have also been found in Delaware. In 2013, the percentages of African American and White 10th graders in Delaware who met the state's math standard differed by 25.4%. This disparity has not changed much since the 26.7% difference in 1993 [3,4]. I would like to explore, based on the information we have now, if these disparities in student performance have changed. Additionally, although disparities have also been found for Hispanic and Latino students in the United States [5], I've found less information / research focusing on this for Delaware. I want to take a look at student performance information across all races, to see if there are any additional educational disparities in Delaware.

## Datasets:

- Student Attendance (https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Attendance/crb4-kdc7)
- Student Growth (https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Growth/kqmb-6xbs)
- Student Dropout (https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Dropout/7u9f-65y3)

## Concerns and Considerations

I briefly looked over the datasets, and it seemed like for some school districts some information was missing. I'm not entirely sure how much or what information is missing or how that might effect the conclusions. Just going to have to work with the information that is there. Other than that, not sure if this research question may be too broad and if I should narrow it down some more?
