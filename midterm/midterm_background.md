# Midterm Background

## Problem: 

Racial inequality and disparity in education. Basically seeing if there is a difference in student performance across different races and analyzing what factors in education might contribute to that. 

## Questions:

- What are the differences in student performance across different races in Delaware?
- Is there currently still a disparity in student performance between white students and students of color in Delaware? 
- If there is a disparity, how might it have changed over time?

## Justification:

In the United States, there has long been a history of educational disparities between African American and White students. There've been records of significant differences in average standardized testing scores between the two groups [1], as well as biases in teacher expectation, which may contribute to performance differences in students [1,2]. These differences have also been found in Delaware. In 2013, the percentages of African American and White 10th graders in Delaware who met the state's math standard differed by 25.4%. This disparity has not changed much since the 26.7% difference in 1993 [3,4]. 

I would like to explore, based on the information we have now, if these disparities in student performance have changed. Additionally, although disparities have also been found for Hispanic and Latino students in the United States [5], I've found less information / research focusing on this for Delaware. I want to take a look at student performance information across all races, to see if there are any additional educational disparities in Delaware.

## Datasets:

- Student Attendance (https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Attendance/crb4-kdc7)
- Student Growth (https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Growth/kqmb-6xbs)
- Student Dropout (https://data.delaware.gov/Education/Student-Dropout/7u9f-65y3)

## Concerns and Considerations

I briefly looked over the datasets, and it seemed like for some school districts some information was missing. I'm not entirely sure how much or what information is missing or how that might effect the conclusions. Just going to have to work with the information that is there. 

My hope in analyzing this data is to help identify a problem and difference in education so that people can be more aware in addressing the issue. My concern is that some may use the info presented to further perpetuate racial stereotypes, or attribute the differences in performance to something inherent to the students, rather than external forces. I really hope people don't come to that kind of conclusion, so I will be careful in how I present my findings. 

I also want to be mindful that differences in student performance in school may not solely be the due to educational inequality, but could be a result of general inequality and effects of stereotypes outside of school. That, though the data may show a problem in education, to effectively address the issue one may have to work on a broader scale and look at factors outside education.
